Use model.py to train the models with data
Use Deep_Models.py to build the models, internally called by model.py
User Model_Evaluation.py to examine/modify/build functions used to evaluate the models and draw the visuals
Finally, use Model_Comparison to train the models used for comparison, i.e., SVM and LSTM and then produce the final visualisations using Model_Evaluation.py

Please note, the dataset used to produce the final results are generated by different runs using model.py, which gets the data loaded in files after each run. Data from individual runs are then manually added to a file for being consumed by Model_Evaluation.py. Consequently, there would not be a single run of the file to reproduce the end-to-end pipeline of the ML.

Similarly, the models being compared are producing individual results in Model_Comparison.py, which are then manually combined in the final forms. Thus, multiple run of this script needs to be done to reproduce the final dataset.

Nevertheless, Model_Comparison.py is set as 'File to Run', as this file can be started with to produce the current set of results. The section of code producing data for comparison models are commented out in the code.
